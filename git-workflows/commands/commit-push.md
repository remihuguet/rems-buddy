## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

## Your task

Based on the above changes:

1. Stage specific files (not `git add -A` or `git add .`)
2. Create a single commit following conventional commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>` — lowercase, imperative mood, under 72 characters
3. Push to the current remote tracking branch

You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. You MUST do all of the above in a single message. Do not use any other tools or do anything else. Do not send any other text or messages besides these tool calls.
